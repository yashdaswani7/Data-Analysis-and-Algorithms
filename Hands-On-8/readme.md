# Data Structures & Quicksort Implementation

## Description

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures (Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List) using fixed-sized arrays, as well as a solution to finding the `i`-th order statistic using the **Quicksort** algorithm. All data structures assume integer storage and are implemented using C-style arrays.

### Contents

1. **Quicksort Implementation for `i`-th Order Statistic**
    - **Description**: This task leverages the Quicksort algorithm to implement a solution for finding the `i`-th smallest element in an unsorted array.
    - **Average Time Complexity**: O(n log n)

2. **Data Structures: Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List**
    - **Description**: Basic implementations of Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List, which simulate the behavior of these structures using fixed-size arrays. Each data structure includes essential operations such as push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, insert, delete, and search.
