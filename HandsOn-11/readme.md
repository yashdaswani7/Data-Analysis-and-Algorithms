## Dynamic Array Implementation in Python

This is a simple implementation of a dynamic array in Python. A dynamic array automatically resizes itself when it reaches capacity, doubling its size to accommodate new elements. This project demonstrates the basic functionality of dynamic arrays, including adding elements, resizing, accessing elements, and handling out-of-bounds errors.

### Features

#### Dynamic Resizing
The array doubles in capacity whenever the current capacity is reached.

#### Basic Operations
- **Add elements** to the array.
- **Access elements** by index.
- **Get the current size and capacity** of the array.
- **Handle out-of-bounds errors** when accessing elements.
